# Battleship

An implementation of Battleship using Javascript for 2 players.

This project is an opportunity for to:
* Get comfortable with Javascript objects
* Flex my object oriented design muscles again
* Learn Jest and write a test suite in Javascript
* Get comfortable with ES6 modules

I've completed the Javascript objects for the Ship and Gameboard, which I think is most of the way there to completing the app. I would like to figure out how to use React for the "display" part of this project, so I am thinking that I should push pause on this application and learn some React.

The idea being that React component data flows downward (ie, I can pass state down, but not up) so it would be best to figure out how I can write a "Game" component that could then manage all the other child components like Gameboard, Ships, etc.
